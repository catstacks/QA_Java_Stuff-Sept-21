//		Create a program that can take two ints as input from the user and can produce the division of these numbers.
//		You can use the Maths project created earlier.
//		This method will need to catch two specific exceptions as well as an overall third exception.
//
//		Handle each of these exceptions within the method and handle them in different ways.
//
//		Recreate the division method to throw your own bespoke exception.
//		This exception will be thrown if the user tries to divide a number (a) by a larger number (b).
//
//		Create a separate class that will be your exception, this class will extend the Exception class.
//		Create and implement the division method so that it takes account of your new exception.
//		Handle this exception in varying ways to show the flexibility of exception handling.
